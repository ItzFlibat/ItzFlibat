## Hi there 👋

My online name is Flibat also known as Kuraa! I was born in the United States (🇺🇸), I'm Mexican-American (🇲🇽). I've been programming for 5+ years now. I'm passionate about open-source projects. I mainly do projects on Roblox and Discord, but occasionally, when I'm bored, I do some projects on GitHub.

In my free time I like to watch movies (🎞️) and anime (📺), to listen to music (🎵)
